Amateur baking allows the creation of cookies, pasties (hand pies), pies, rolls, simple breads, and round or sheet cakes.
An amateur cannot create wedding cakes, pizzas, cinnamon rolls, croissants, souffles, breads with complex shapes (like challah), or layered items such as baumkuchen, baklava, napoleons, and goods made from philo dough.
An amateur baker can use frosting (butter-based) to cover a baked good, but he has no competence with icing (sugar-based), used for piping and decorations.
