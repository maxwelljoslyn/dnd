Clerics have the following special abilities:

- The cleric will enjoy social benefits from any who share his religion, and increased social status wherever there is local belief in his religion.


- Clerics can [cast spells](/dnd/spellcasting): see [List of Cleric Spells](/dnd/clericspells). A cleric need not openly wear or brandish a holy symbol to cast spells; this rule exists so clerics may hide their faith from enemies.

  A cleric with 9-11 Wisdom may suffer <strong>spell failure</strong>. This represents a struggle to memorize and recite prayers, given the character's Wisdom was only barely sufficient for class training. On the other hand, a cleric with a high Wisdom earns bonus spells.

  Finally, a minimum Wisdom score is required to cast 6th- and 7th-level cleric spells. See [Wisdom](/dnd/wisdom).

- Clerics can [turn the undead](/dnd/turnundead).
