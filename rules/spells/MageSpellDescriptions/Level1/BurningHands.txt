Area of Effect: 120-degree arc, out to 15 feet
Save: none
Type: Evocation

Burning Hands shoots a searing sheet of flames out of the caster's hand. The spell works in a 120-degree arc out from the caster, affecting all the hexes in that arc out to to indicated distance: two hexes adjacent to the caster, four hexes at 10 feet away, and six hexes at 15 feet away. The spell does 1d4 damage +1 point/level.

The spell will affect all creatures indiscriminately, though the caster's allies may duck to avoid the flames with a successful Wisdom check. The highest point from which the spell can be launched is 1 foot higher than the caster's height; the spell's effect can thus easily be launched over the heads of shorter creatures. The sheet of flame can also be angled up to 45 degrees upward or downward.

Flammable materials, such as paper, loose fibres and open oil, must make a saving throw against magical fire or be ignited. The heat of the flames and the endurance are insufficient to harm woven clothing, wood, leather, metal, glass, foods and other like materials, though some foods could be significantly browned by the spell.
