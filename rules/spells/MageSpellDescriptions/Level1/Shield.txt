Shield creates an invisible magical barrier in front of the mage. This barrier confers the following benefits, which are effective *only* against attacks which are made from the front:

1) Magic Missile attacks are totally negated.

2) The mage gets AC 2 vs. hand-propelled missiles, such as axes, daggers, and spears.

3) The mage gets AC 3 vs. mechanically-assisted missiles, such as arrows, bolts, and bullets. This score also applies against a giant's thrown boulders or against natural attacks which are missiles, such as acid spit or manticore spikes.

4) The mage gets AC 4 against all other attacks.
