Shield creates an invisible magical barrier around the caster. This barrier confers the following benefits, effective against all attacks (not just those made from the front):

1) Magic Missiles are totally negated.

2) The caster gets AC 18 vs. hand-propelled missiles, such as axes, daggers, and spears.

3) The caster gets AC 17 vs. mechanically-assisted missiles, such as arrows, bolts, and bullets. This score also applies against a giant's thrown boulders or against natural attacks which are missiles, such as acid spit or manticore spikes.

4) The caster gets AC 16 against all other attacks.
