New Hit Die

At level up, if the new level is 10 or less, a character gains a new Hit Die. The character then rolls that size Hie Die, plus all bonuses, to determine the amount of HP they add to their total.

The player's die roll for new HP at level up is not allowed to be a 1; the die is rerolled until a 1 does not show. If the character has a penalty to the HP roll, the minimum HP gained at level up is 1. Thus a character with a -1 penalty who rolls a 2 on the die is just unlucky: they don't get a reroll and gain only 1 HP.

At first level the HD is maximum: there is no need to roll. This helps even the field for the player characters, who will suffer many more attacks over their lifetimes than enemies will.
