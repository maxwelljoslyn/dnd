These are the steps for creating a new first-level character, including henchmen of higher-level characters.

## Generate and Assign Ability Scores

First, you will create six random numbers; these will become your character's **ability scores**. Each number is created by rolling 4 six-sided dice (4d6), removing the lowest one, and summing the three remaining dice. This is referred to as "4d6, drop lowest."

When making your *primary* player character, if *none* of the six numbers are 15 or higher, *all* six of the numbers are scrapped, and re-rolled. Repeat this process until the set of scores includes at least one score of 15 or greater.

If the character you are making is a *henchman* of a primary character, you get what you get; the first round of six numbers is accepted no matter the results.

The scores generated above are assigned as desired to the six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. A character's ability scores determine his fundamental strengths and weaknesses, and will influence most of the actions you can take in the game world.

## Choose Character Race and Class

As you assign ability scores, review the options for character **races** and **classes**.

Your character's class determines the majority of your character's skills and talents, and is the most important decision you will make in character creation. Your character's race may modify your starting ability scores, as well as offer other rules benefits and roleplay opportunities.

Each class has one or more ability score requirements. Thus, the decisions of what class to play, what race to be, and where to assign your ability scores are all interdependent. Experiment with different possiblities as much as you like, and don't be afraid to ask the DM for advice.

### Just Can't Decide?

If you really don't know what to play, you *cannot* go wrong with a human fighter. Every party can use additional fighters. Though no less complex than other characters, it is easy to learn to play a fighter who makes crucial contributions to the party's wellbeing: "get between your allies and your enemies, then hit the latter." As for humans, as the most numerous civilized race, and the only one with no special game effects, they are the "vanilla" choice.

## Choose Sex and Name

Any **name** may be chosen, as long as it is neither a joke nor a deliberate, jokey reference to pop culture. Ordinary, mythological, fantastical, and totally-made-up names are all fine.

Here are some names of former characters in my world: Arvak, Brutus, George.

A character's **sex** may be male or female. Apart from height and weight distributions, male and female characters have *exactly* the same game stats, and can choose any class.

### A Note on Sex and Gender

My world contains people who are gay or lesbian (historically called "inverts"); who defy their culture's gender roles; or who inhabit a socially-accepted "third" or "neuter" gender (like eunuchs and hijras.) However, none of these are properly described with contemporary notions of transgender and non-binary identities. My game world is set in the 1600s, and while it is hardly "historically accurate," it is also not revisionist.

As an adventurer, your character necessarily exists outside typical social norms, so you are free to play characters who go against gender roles. However, you must understand that this may make your character's adventures more difficult. Think carefully about the potential consequences of playing against normative gender roles in a world that is harsh, dangerous, xenophobic, superstitious, and ignorant.

Finally, while it is mostly up to you whether your character feels comfortable in his own skin, or whether your character is interested in sex, note that the character background generator may constrain some such decisions.

## Generate Background

It is assumed that many life-shaping events happened to your character while he was growing up, and while he was being trained to first level in his character class. The results of those events are collectively referred to as your character's **background**. This capsule history of your character's life ends at the point where you "took control" of him, and its details are heavily influenced by how you arrange your character's ability scores.

With the DM's help, enter your character's name, sex, race, and class into the character background generator. This program will determine and output a snapshot of your character's life before he chose a life of adventure.

## Generate Mass HP

A character's first-level maximum Hit Points (HP) are determined not only by his character class and Constitution score, but also by his lean body mass. After you learn your character's effective weight from the background generator, the DM will instruct you to roll certain dice. The die result, your **mass HP**, will be added to the HP total determined by your class and Constitution.

## Pick Weapon Proficencies

As with all other aspects of character creation, you are not locked into those choices until gameplay begins. You will probably wish to hold off on selecting proficiencies until you've reviewed the equipment tables, and learned the strengths and weaknesses of the weapons available to your character class.

## Pick Magic Spells

If your character can use magic, you will have to choose the spells your character can cast from the list of first-level spells available to your character's class. Choose carefully and wisely, and, as with all matters related to character generation, do not hesitate to seek the DM's advice. Don't forget that all spellcasting characters will learn many more spells as they level up.

## Purchase Equipment

The final step in character creation is to purchase initial equipment. Remember to buy clothing, food, and ammunition for any ranged weapons.

You are allowed and encouraged to pool money between characters, if desired. If your character possesses credit, you may use it while making initial purchases.
