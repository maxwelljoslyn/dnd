## Introduction

Horses consume two kinds of food: *forage* (hay and grasses) which can be found while traveling in most biomes, and *horse feed*, a supplement which must be added to a horse's diet.

The daily requirements for feeding a horse are:
- 2.5% of the horse's body weight in forage
- 2 lbs of horse feed (regardless of the horse's weight)

If a horse is transported, or is kept in a part of the world where grass does not naturally grow, forage must be actively supplied to the horse.

## Unfed Horses

A horse which goes with limited or no food has little ability to serve its master .
