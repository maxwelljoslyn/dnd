Special abilities:

<!-- - When a humanoid enemy is surprised (*not* merely stunned), the assassin may attempt to instantly kill that enemy. An attack is rolled with a +4 bonus; if it hits, the assassin rolls the appropriate percentage chance listed on the [Assassination Chance Table.](/files/AssassinationChanceTable.png) A result equal or lower to the listed number means that the enemy has been assassinated. A failure still results in regular weapon damage. -->

<!--    Only humanoids can be assassinated, unless the assassin has biological knowledge relating to other types of creatures, in which case such creatures may be assassinated as well. -->

<!--     Note that assassination is not a superpower. Assassins will have to do some work to set up the opportunity for an assassination. You do not just walk past someone in broad daylight, spin around and magically instakill them, as in the Assassin's Creed videogames. But attempting to sneak up to someone, at night, while camouflaged: that's a good start. See Awareness and Sneaking. -->

- Assassins are only surprised 1 in 6 when in urban areas.

 <!-- For the purposes of opening locks, sneaking, picking pockets, and noticing traps, assassins are treated as a thief of two levels lower; thus they do not gain any advantages until 3rd level. The assassin's chance to danger climb is ordinary. -->


- At 13th level, the assassin will attract followers: 4d4 1st level assassins.
