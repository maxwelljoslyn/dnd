Paladin level information:

![](/files/PaladinLevels.png)

Minimum ability scores to be a paladin: Strength 9, Constitution 9, Wisdom 9, Charisma 12.

A paladin with Strength, Wisdom, and Charisma all at 15 or greater gains 10% bonus experience points.

Paladins can use any weapon and all armor and shields.

Paladins have the following special abilities:

- They make all saving throws with a +1 bonus on the die roll.

- They are immune to all diseases.

- They may lay hands on themselves or another to cure wounds. Laying hands cures 2 points of damage per paladin level, and it can be performed once per day. In combat, laying hands costs 1 AP.

- Paladins may cast [Detect Malevolence](/pages/spells/DetectMalevolence) at will.

- A paladin wielding a holy weapon will cause a Dispel Magic effect on a critical hit. Such a weapon will be very difficult to find.

- A paladin of 2nd level or higher may cure diseases. This requires 4 hours of prayer by the paladin, followed by bestowing the blessing which removes the disease. The diseased person must be present for the whole period of prayer. The number of times a paladin may cure disease is 1 time per week at level 5 or lower, 2 times per week from levels 6 to 10, 3 times per week from level 11 to 15, and 4 times a week above level 15.

- At 3rd level, a paladin gains the ability to [turn undead](/pages/TurnUndead) as a cleric two levels lower than the paladin level. This ability increases as the paladin gains more levels; thus, a 4th level paladin will turn undead as a 2nd level cleric, and so on.

- At 4th level or at any time after attaining that level, a paladin may call for his unique warhorse. This steed is a special variety of heavy warhorse: it has AC 5 and is as fast as a medium warhorse. In addition, it has an Intelligence of 4, higher than ordinary horses. This intelligence, plus the divine bond linking paladin and horse, ensures that the two will act as one, preventing the horse from routing, breaking in the face of a charge, or 

    The paladin's warhorse will magically appear when it is first called, but, if it is killed, it will disappear, and cannot be summoned again for a year and a day.

- At 9th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast cleric spells. However, they are still unable to use magic scrolls, even if they are literate. Note also that regardless of Wisdom score, the paladin does not receive bonus spells as a cleric would.

Paladins are subject to the following restrictions:

- A paladin may possess no more than 10 magic items: 1 suit of armor, 1 shield, 4 weapons, and any 4 other magic items. Note that in the case of magic ranged weapons and magic ammunition, a single type of magical ammunition may be counted along with such a weapon as a single item. Further quantities of ammunition will be counted as an additional single weapon (not miscellaneous item) as long as they are all of one type. Even a single piece of ammo of another type will be counted as another weapon against the paladin's limit.
