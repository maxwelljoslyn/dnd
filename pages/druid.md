Druids have the following special abilities:

- Druids can cast [spells](/dnd/spellcasting).

- Druids gain a +2 on saving throws against attacks which deal fire or electric damage.

- At 3rd level, the druid gains the ability to identify plant type (including plant creatures) and animal type (including beasts.) They also become able to tell if water is drinkable, and whether it is pure. Finally, at this level they also become able to move through overgrowth (thorns, briar patches, large weeds, etc.) without leaving a trail or slowing their movement speed.

- At 6th level, the druid gains immunity from any Charm-school spells cast by sylvan creatures: pixies, sylphs, leprechauns, and so on.

- At 7th level, the druid gains the power of transforming into animals. This power can be used once per day at 7th level, twice at 8th, and three times at 9th. A druid who transforms can become any bird, reptile, or mammal, assuming all physical characteristics of that animal, but not its mind. This includes a change in Hit Dice and hit points!

    1. A druid can only assume a particular form once each day.

    2. The smallest creature available for each category: bluejay, bullfrog, fruit bat. The largest creature available for the category: eagle, 10-foot snake, black bear.

    3. Changing form restores 10-60% of of lost hit points sustained in the current form. For example, Darren has a maximum of 24 hit points as a human, but right now he's lost 10 and is down to 14. He decides to change shape. After making this decision, he rolls a d6, gets a 3, and multiplies by 10. He has lost 10 hit points, so 30% of those, or 3 HP, is restored, leaving his current form with 17 HP. His HD and HP will now change to match the new form, but the ratio of current to maximum HP will still equal 17/24! Note that hit points are not restored when returning to normal form.
