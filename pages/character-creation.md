These are the steps for creating a new first-level character, including henchmen of higher-level characters.

## Generate and Assign Ability Scores

First, you will create six random numbers; these will become your character's **ability scores**. Each number is created by rolling 4 six-sided dice (4d6), removing the lowest one, and summing the three remaining dice. This is referred to as "4d6, drop lowest."

When making your *primary* player character, if *none* of the six numbers are 15 or higher, *all* six of the numbers are scrapped, and re-rolled. Repeat this process until the set of scores includes at least one score of 15 or greater.

If the character you are making is a *henchman* of a primary character, you get what you get; the first round of six numbers is accepted no matter the results.

The scores generated above are assigned as desired to the six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

A character's ability scores determine his fundamental strengths and weaknesses, and will influence most of the actions you can take in the game world.

## Choose Character Race and Class

As you assign ability scores, review the options for character **races** and **classes**.

Your character's class determines the majority of your character's skills and talents, and is the most important decision you will make in character creation. Your character's race may modify your starting ability scores, as well as offer other rules benefits and roleplay opportunities.

Each class has one or more ability score requirements. Thus, the decisions of what class to play, what race to be, and where to assign your ability scores are all interdependent. Experiment with different possiblities as much as you like, and don't be afraid to ask the DM for advice.

If you really don't know what to play, you *cannot* go wrong with a human fighter. Fighters are no less complex than other characters, but they are easiest to learn, and every party can use additional muscle. As for humans, as the most numerous civilized race, and the only one with no special game effects, they are the "vanilla" choice.

## Choose Sex and Name

Any name may be chosen, as long as it is not a joke (including deliberate, jokey references to another piece of media.)

A character's sex may be male or female. Apart from height and weight distributions, male and female characters have exactly the same game stats, and can be of any class.


My game world is set in the 1600s, and while it is not "historically accurate," it is also not revisionist. While gender roles and sexual mores have varied between societies, and changed over time, *21st-century conceptions* of transgender and non-binary identities were not part of any 17th-century society. As such, while you are not forbidden to create a character who defies gender stereotypes, you are not permitted to create a character with a *21st-century* transgender or non-binary identity. Such people are not part of this milieu.


My world *does* contain people who defy certain aspects of traditional gender roles, or who inhabit a socially-constructed "third" or "neuter" gender, such as eunuchs and hijras. Such people do not conform to current progressive notions of transgenderism, making it fruitless to use 21st-century terms and concepts to describe them. You are encouraged to think carefully about the potential consequences of playing against normative gender roles in a world that is harsh, dangerous, xenophobic, superstitious, and ignorant.


Allowing players to pick these identities for their characters would all but guarantee that other contemporary assumptions would be applied to the game world, which would only retard players' ability to learn the game and adapt to its world.

Finally, while it is mostly up to you whether your character feels comfortable in his own skin, whether your character is interested in sex, and whether your character is straight or gay, note that the character background generator may constrain some of those decisions.

## Generate Background

It is assumed that many life-shaping events happened to your character while he was growing up, and while he was being trained to first level in his character class. The results of those events are collectively referred to as your character's **background**. This capsule history of your character's life ends at the point where you "took control" of him, and its details are heavily influenced by how you arrange your character's ability scores.

With the DM's help, enter your character's name, sex, race, and class into the character background generator. This program will determine and output a snapshot of your character's life before he chose a life of adventure.

## Generate Mass HP

A character's first-level maximum Hit Points (HP) are determined not only by his character class and Constitution score, but also by his lean body mass. After you learn your character's effective weight from the background generator, the DM will instruct you to roll certain dice. The die result, your **mass HP**, will be added to the HP total determined by your class and Constitution.

## Pick Weapon Proficencies

As with all other aspects of character creation, you are not locked into those choices until gameplay begins. You will probably wish to hold off on selecting proficiencies until you've reviewed the equipment tables, and learned the strengths and weaknesses of the weapons available to your character class.

## Pick Magic Spells

If your character can use magic, you will have to choose the spells your character can cast from the list of first-level spells available to your character's class. Choose carefully and wisely, and, as with all matters related to character generation, do not hesitate to seek the DM's advice. Don't forget that all spellcasting characters will learn many more spells as they level up.

## Purchase Equipment

The final step in character creation is to purchase initial equipment. Remember to buy clothing, food, and ammunition for any ranged weapons.

You are allowed and encouraged to pool money between characters, if desired. If your character possesses credit, you may use it while making initial purchases.
