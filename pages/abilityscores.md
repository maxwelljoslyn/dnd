<strong>Ability scores</strong> are the core measure of a character's natural strengths and weaknesses. The six ability scores are:

- [Strength](/dnd/strength)
- [Dexterity](/dnd/dexterity)
- [Constitution](/dnd/constitution)
- [Intelligence](/dnd/intelligence)
- [Wisdom](/dnd/wisdom)
- [Charisma](/dnd/charisma)

Ability scores typically range from 3 to 18. Higher is better. Each character class requires minimum scores for one or more abilities.

## Generating Ability Scores

When creating a player character, six scores from 3-18 are generated by rolling 4d6 and dropping the lowest die. The player assigns those scores to the six abilities as desired.

### Rerolling Ability Scores

If the generated scores don't contain at least one score of 15 or greater, <strong>all six scores are rerolled</strong>. This continues until the set of generated scores contains at least one score of 15 or greater. This reroll rule only applies to a player's primary PC, and not to henchmen or any other player-controlled character. In those cases, the scores you roll are the ones you get.

Rationale: players are more willing to be invested long-term in a main character with at least one high score.
