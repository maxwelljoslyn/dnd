Burning Hands shoots a sheet of flames out of the caster's hand. The spell works in a 120-degree arc out from the caster, affecting all the hexes in that arc out to a distance of ten feet (a total of six hexes, two adjacent to the magic user and four beyond those.)

The spell does 1 point of damage per level of the caster. Flammable materials caught in the effect must save against catching fire.
