This spell causes its targets to fall into a deep slumber. Targets can be roused as normal sleeping creatures, save for the fact that noise, no matter how loud, will not be able to wake them up.

Affected creatures are counted against the spell's HD limit from weakest to strongest. Creatures with no Hit Dice (both non-threatening and less than 5 pounds, e.g. kittens, frogs) do not count against the spell's target limit. A creature which is immune or resistant to the spell still counts against the limit, just as a creature which is resistant to fire damage can still be the target of fire spells.

Creatures above 4 HD are not affected.
