This spell creates and launches a magical energy bolt at the target. Magic missiles hit automatically, with no attack roll needed, and each one does d4+1 damage (2-5).

At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, the spell produces an additional missile, up to a maximum of 5 missiles at 9th level. The mage can direct these missiles at multiple creatures, if desired.
