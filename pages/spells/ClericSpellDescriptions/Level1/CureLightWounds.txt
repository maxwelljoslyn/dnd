Cure Light Wounds heals d4+4 HP. This spell cannot affect creatures
without corporeal bodies, nor can it restore HP to undead, constructs,
or other non-living creatures.

The creature that is touched heals as many HP as it is able; there is
no chance for the cleric to purposely limit the flow of healing to
save it for another target. However, should a recipient reaches full
HP before all of the spell's healing is expended, then the spell is
not fully discharged, and will remain usable into the next round. The remainder of the
healing may be given to another target, as long as this is done in the
next round; otherwise the spell dissipates and the rest of the healing
is wasted.

The above rules for expending healing on multiple recipients can go
beyond a second target to as many as possible, as long as a new target
is still touched each round. If the targets are not clumped togther
this may prove impossible, since the cleric can still only move 5 feet
per round while maintaining concentration on the spell.

The reversed spell will deal the same amount of damage if a touch attack succeeds. If this attack fails, the spell is not discharged.
