name: Wounds

When a defender receives 11 or more damage from a *single* weapon attack, then the defender also receives a <strong>wound</strong>. Starting on the next round, until the wound is closed, the character will "bleed" hit points each round.

For each full multiple of 11 damage done by an attack, the resulting wound will rob the character of 1 HP/round. A wound which bleeds N damage per round is sometimes called an N-point wound. Thus:

- attack causes 11 to 21 damage -> bleed 1 HP/round
- attack causes 22 to 32 damage -> bleed 2 HP/round
- attack causes 33 to 43 damage -> bleed 3 HP/round
- attack causes 11N to 11(N+1)-1 damage -> bleed N HP/round

Damage from wounds is taken at the beginning of the wounded creature's turn.

A creature may receive multiple wounds in one round. A creature struck twice, for 13 and 15 hit points, would receive a 1-point wound from each attack, resulting in a loss of 2 HP per round.

If a character is holding a shield which has not been strapped on, receiving a wound will cause the character to drop their shield.

Note: the damage caused by bleeding may be sufficient to stun the wounded creature. This is a very dangerous situation! Without outside help, the character will be continually stunned and unable to bind their own wounds, meaning they will bleed to death.

## Healing Wounds
 
- Wounds may be physically bound with bandages. Characters with the [Medicine sage study](/dnd/medicine) are faster at bandaging wounds, but anyone can do it.
- Any magical healing, even a single point, will close all of a creature's wounds. This includes HP-restoring magical effects which are not spells, such as a [paladin's](/dnd/paladin) laying on hands.
- Eating a [goodberry](/dnd/spells/goodberry) will close one wound.

## Immunity to Wounds

Certain creatures cannot be effectively wounded, including oozes, undead, gaseous creatures, golems, and other creatures composed of non-flesh materials.

Creatures which regenerate <em>can</em> be wounded; the wound is seen as slowing their rate of regeneration.
