Minimum ability scores to be an illusionist: Dexterity 9, Intelligence 12.

An illusionist with 15 or greater Intelligence gains 10% bonus experience points.

Illusionists have the same armor and weapon restrictions as [mages](/pages/Mage).

Illusionists have the following special abilities:

- Illusionists can cast spells. They gain a certain number of spells each level, and they may cast each spell they know once per day. If a spell is used, in order to regain its power the next day, the illusionist must get at least 6 hours of sleep, then meditate for 15 minutes per spell level. Spells that are not used on a given day are carried over to the following day and are useable without further meditation, but the once-per-day limit still applies.
