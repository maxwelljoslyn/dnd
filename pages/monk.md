Monk level information:

Because there are many monk abilities, their descriptions are split into those which are present at first level, and those which are gained through leveling. The following abilities are all active at first level:

- Monks gain bonus Action Points (AP), which govern how much a character can do in one combat turn.

- Monks deal extra damage when attacking unarmed. This may be done with either hand, as long as the striking hand is empty and no gauntlets or other coverings are worn.

- When attacking unarmed, monks may stun or even kill their opponent. On a total attack roll of 25 or greater, the killing chance is assessed as follows: treat the opponent's AC as the base percentage, and then add 1 for every level the monk has above 10, or subtract 1 for every level below 10. Thus, a 1st level monk who successfully attacks a creature with AC 10 has a (10-9) = 1% chance of an instant kill.
    
    As long as the chance to kill is 1% or higher, then even if the enemy is not killed, the enemy will still be stunned for one round. This stun is exactly like a stun from dealing 25% or more of the enemy's current HP in a single hit.

- When attacked by non-magical missiles (arrows, bolts, slingstones, or thrown weapons), if the attack would normally hit, the monk has a chance to dodge it by making a Petrification saving throw. Each missile requires its own save.

- When attacked by spells or area effects which deal partial damage on a save, a monk will instead take no damage on a save. At 9th level, even if the monk doesn't make their save, they will still only take half damage. Thus, the outcomes before 9th level are full damage or no damage, and at 9th level the outcomes are half damage or no damage.

- Monks are counted as thieves of the same level for the purposes of climbing walls.

The following abilities are gained as the monk levels up.

- Starting at 2nd level, a monk has a lower-than-ordinary chance of being surprised. The exact numbers are on the table. Any modifications to chance of being surprised which are expressed as chances in 6 are converted to percentages and applied to the monk as normal, with the caveat that a monk's chance to be surprised cannot drop below 1%.

- At 3rd level, a monk gains +1 bonus damage when fighting with any weapon with which they are proficient (but not when unarmed.) This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level, +3 at 9th level, and so on. 

- At 3rd level, a monk gains the ability to speak with animals, as the druid spell.

- Starting at 4th level, monks can ignore a certain amount of damage from a fall, as long as they are within 5 feet of a wall while falling. At 4th level, a monk can fall safely up to 25 feet; at 8th level, 50 feet; at 12th level, 100 feet.

    If a fall exceeds the safe length but a wall is available for the whole fall, the monk may subtract this length from the actual length fallen when calculating damage. For example, a 4th level monk who falls 50 feet while within 1 hex of a wall may calculate damage as if he fell only 25 feet. Note that wherever walls are mentioned in these rules for escaping falling damage, a similar surface, such as a cliff face or tree trunk, is also suitable.

- At 4th level, a monk gains the ability to mask his mind such that ESP and other mind-reading spells only have a limited chance of affecting him. The chance of being affected is equal to the monk's reduced surprise chance.

- At 5th level, the monk becomes immune to all diseases, and is also not affected by the Haste spell or its reverse, Slow.

- At 6th level, the monk becomes able to feign death by inducing a catalepsy in himself. The monk can lower his heart rate and his body temperature as part of the ability, so it will fool all observers, even if they have spells for detecting life force. The monk requires only a single round (12 seconds) to induce this state or to break out of it, but must stay in it for a minimum of ten minutes per usage. The feign death ability can be used for a maximum of 20 minutes per level per day. If a monk is poisoned prior to using this ability, the poison will be halted temporarily while the monk is feigning death, but will resume circulating through the monk's body when the catalepsy is dismissed.

- At 7th level, a monk gains the ability to heal himself of damage. The amount of HP healed is d4+7; this increases to d4+8 at 8th level, d4+9 at 9th level, and so on. A monk can heal himself once per day. Self-healing requires 2 AP when performed in combat.

- At 8th level, the monk gains the ability to speak with plants, as the druid spell.

- At 8th level, a monk attracts followers: 1d3 1st level monks, plus 1d3 more if he has a stronghold.

- At 9th level, the monk gains a 40% resistance to spells such as Suggestion, Charm Person, Hypnosis, and other enchantment effects. This resistance increases by 5% per level thereafter. As with all spell resistance, saving throws still apply if resistance fails.

- At 10th level, the monk gains immunity to telepathy. Not only can his mind not be read, but he is also immune to mind blasts and other telepathic attacks.

- At 11th level, the monk becomes immune to all poisons.

- At 12th level, the monk can no longer be affected by the Geas and Quest spells.

- At 13th level, the monk gains the use of the quivering palm, a most powerful martial arts technique. The monk makes an attack which sets up deadly vibrations in the body of an enemy. Afterward, the monk can mentally cause the vibrations to cease, slaying the enemy. The quivering palm is limited as follows:

  1. It can only be attempted once per week.

  2. The player of the monk must announce the intended victim. The monk must touch that victim within 3 rounds.

  3. The quivering palm cannot affect constructs or undead creatures, but can otherwise affect any living creature.

  4. The victim cannot have more hit dice than the monk. Should this condition be invalid when the intended target is declared, the ability will simply fail to function, and the monk will know instinctively that the enemy is too powerful. This will not waste the usage for the week.

  5. The command to die (which takes no AP, and is a purely mental action) must be given within a certain time limit. This limit is 1 day per level that the monk has when the power is used.

Monks are subject to certain restrictions. These are:

  - Unlike other character classes, monks do not gain any to-hit bonus or damage bonus from their Strength score. In addition, monks do not gain the normal defense bonus to AC from Dexterity.

  - Monks may only retain a certain amount of magic items. They may possess no more than two magic weapons and three other magic items at any time.
