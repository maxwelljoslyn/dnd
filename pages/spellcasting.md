These are the general rules for spellcasting. For spell descriptions, see [the list of spells](/pages/ListOfSpells).

## Spellcasting in Society

Under almost all circumstances[^1], if someone is casting a spell, it is impossible to tell which spell they are casting until it has been cast. Fireball or Find The Path? Holy Word or Power Word? You won't know -- but neither will your enemies.

Given these rules

Thus, the casting of a spell in public is sure to provoke fear, anger,  unless the caster is one of the following:

- a priest (of a known-friendly religion)
- a nobleman or 


## Casting Spells

Casting requires the spellcaster to speak clearly, in a normal tone of voice, and it requires the use of one hand for gestures. Discharging a spell also requires a free hand. No material components are necessary.

An entity **cannot** take any other actions in a round when it is casting. If you meet an entity which seems to violate this rule, exercise extreme caution.

If a spell is reversible, the spellcaster chooses which version to use when they prepare spells. If the spell has multiple applications, the particular application can be chosen at the time of casting the spell.

If the caster is damaged or interrupted while casting, the spell is ruined and wasted. 

Once cast, a spell must be discharged in the round after the spell finishes casting, or the spell dissipates and the casting is wasted. The spellcaster can only move 5 feet before discharging the spell, and can't take other actions until the spell is discharged.



## Preparing Spells

To prepare spells, a caster must meditate or pray (depending on class) for 15 minutes per spell level per spell. Thus, preparing a single 3rd level spell requires 45 minutes of meditation/prayer.

If a spell is reversible, the caster chooses one version when preparing the spell.  If the spell can perform one of a variety of functions, the caster picks which function to use at the time of casting.

[^1]: (The only guaranteed way to identify a spell before it's cast is by being an Illusionist who has learned enough Metaphysics to gain a particular ability.)
