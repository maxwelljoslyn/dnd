$var title: Illuminati

<p>This rare and powerful sage study is available only to those who have been inducted into the Illuminati. Little is known about this organization save by those who are part of it.</p>

<h2>Novice Members</h2>

<p>Player characters have a small chance to begin gameplay as a novice member of the Illuminati, as a rare result on the background generator. The minimum Wisdom to have a chance of beginning gameplay as an Illuminatus is 17. A character with a 17 Wisdom has a 5% chance; a character with 18 Wisdom, a 10% chance.</p>

<p>A novice knows one or two basic secret signs by which to recognize other Illuminati. They may attend Councils by invitation only, and then without voting privileges. The character will gain d4-1 points per level in this sage study; once he reaches 10 points, Amateur status, he attains the rank of Secret Master (see below.)</p>

$#(On 4d6 drop lowest, the roll used for each ability stat, there is approximately a 5.8% chance of getting 17 or 18 -- before accounting for racial modifiers, such as the <a href="/rules/gnome">gnome</a> bonus to Wisdom.) <p>
