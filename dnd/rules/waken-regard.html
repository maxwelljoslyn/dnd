<h1>Waken Regard</h1>

<p>
Falcons are a sign of breeding and status among elite societies. This ability represents a foot in the door with regard to forming associations with the upper crust of society.
</p>

<p>
Even as an amateur falconer, the character will be singled out for positive attention by squires, knights, or perhaps even the lowest-ranking nobility (baronets and barons) and their retinue, who will be interested in the character and his or her ambitions. For a given six-mile hex where such an individual currently resides, within two weeks of the falconer's arrival in the area, they are guaranteed to receive some measure of notice or regard as detailed above.
</p>

<p>
Waken Regard does not guarantee anything beyond the initial positive contact, nor does it protect the falconer from the consequences of any inappropriate conduct.
