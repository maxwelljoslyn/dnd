$var title: Bird Companionship

<p>
A falconer and his birds form a powerful bond which enhances zest for life and bolsters the spirits. As long as one of the character's <strong>trained</strong> falcons is visible and within 60 feet (whether tethered or free), the falconer earns +5% bonus XP from combat (not treasure.)
</p>

<p>Conforming to rules for animals with Intelligence of 1, the falconer is capable of giving basic directions to a trained falcon as follows.</p>

<p>
The falcon's starting morale is 8 (higher is better; morale runs 3 to 18.)
</p>

<p>
The falcon can be made to come when called, to find food (as <a href="/rules/rouse-to-hunt">Rouse to Hunt</a>), to roost in a mews or on a perch, or to sleep (once hooded.) The falcon cannot be given any other instructions unless the falconer is able to speak with the bird (such as by casting <span class=spell>Speak With Animals</span>, or using the Expert ability Bird Whispering).
</p>

<p>
Unless cornered, out hunting, or protecting its master, the falcon will require a morale check to attack. (This limitation goes away when the falconer achieves Authority status and gains the Bird Strike ability.)
</p>

<p>
If the master is attacked, and the falcon sees, it will rush to its master's defense. It will do so even if the falconer orders it to "rest" (back off), unless it successfully makes an Intelligence check (unlikely, with its Intelligence of 1.)
</p>

<p>
If the falconer is able to speak with the bird, however, it can be given a direct order (presuming it is something which the animal can do) that it will obey for three melee rounds. Once the three rounds have passed, the master must spend a full round reacquiring its attention in order to issue new instructions. If the bird is beyond 40 feet away, however, it must be first called for, so that it can return to where it will be close enough to speak.
