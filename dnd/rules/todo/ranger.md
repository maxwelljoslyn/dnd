Rangers have the following special abilities:

- When fighting certain enemies, rangers add a +1 bonus per level (maximum of +10) to their damage rolls.

    At 1st level, this bonus applies to all animals and vermin, but not against beasts (dire, magical, or otherwise special creatures.) At 5th level, the bonus also applies against beasts and plant creatures. At 9th level, the bonus also applies against sylvan and fairy creatures: brownies, leprechauns, and so forth.

- Rangers acting in the wilderness increase opponent surprise chances by 1, but the ranger only has this increased chance of surprising opponents if the ranger is acting alone, or in a group where all members have the stealth ability.

- Rangers are only surprised on a 1 in 6 when in the wilderness.

- Rangers can track other creatures. See Tracking.

- At 8th level, the ranger gain the ability to cast [druid spells](/dnd/druidspells). If the ranger is literate or becomes so, they can also use druid scrolls.

- At 9th level, the ranger gains the ability to cast [mage spells](/dnd/magespells). If the ranger is literate or becomes so, they can also use mage scrolls.

- At 10th level, the ranger attracts 2d12 followers. Some or all of these followers may be unusual creatures, including wild beasts and monsters, who will be as loyal to the ranger as regular followers are. The exact followers attracted by the ranger are determined by rolling a table specific to the biome where the ranger obtained 10th level.
