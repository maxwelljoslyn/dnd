This spell allows the caster to manipulate the size and light-casting properties of a fire of a certain size, which can be as small as that of a torch, or as large as that of a regular campfire approximately 3' in diameter. Once the spell has been discharged on a target fire, that fire can be made to reduce in size and/or dim in light intensity to that of a match. If not reduced in size, it can instead be made to grow much brighter (although not any larger), thus shedding light as a Light spell. The fire will retain its new size and/or light level until the spell ends, even if the spell is switched to a different target (see below).

Predefined sizes are: match, candle, torch/lantern, campfire. Predefined light intensities are: match, candle, torch/lantern, campfire, Light spell. For more information related to light sources, their properties, and ability to see, see Visibility.

The caster can repeatedly change the fire's properties within these parameters, each time speaking modifications to the spell (1 AP). The caster can switch the spell to a different fire for 1 AP, although this does not immediately manipulate the new fire.

This spell cannot create a fire where there is none, nor can it completely extinguish a fire (although a fire could run out of fuel). Fuel consumption is reduced or increased by 25%, measuring from the fire's original size, for each "step" of size or illumination by which the fire is weakened or strengthened.
