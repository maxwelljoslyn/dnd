As above, with these additions:

The target of this spell will regard the caster as a friend and ally. The target will not take actions which would specifically endanger itself, such as "jump off that cliff." If the target is combat-trained, it will defend the caster if ordered to do so. If not combat-trained, it will physically interpose itself between the caster and a specific threat.

The target is still subject to all morale checks just as if it weren't charmed. The spell does not grant any kind of fearlessness, even in defense of the caster.

The target can stray as far as desired from the caster, but will take orders exactly and only from the spellcaster (written or verbal.)

If the caster harms or attempts to harm the target, the spell is immediately broken.

Unless the spellcaster was discreet at the time of casting, the target will know who it was that charmed them. However, this is not a sixth sense: if, for example, the caster was masked while casting the spell, and the target is presented with a lineup of possible casters after the spell breaks, the target will not possess any special intuition or knowledge about which person was the caster.
