Charm Person Or Mammal
Area of Effect: one person or mammalian creature

Except for the above, this spell is the same as the 1st level mage spell.

The caster should note well that this spell does not in itself allow communication with an animal; other spells, such as Speak With Animals, must be employed for that.
