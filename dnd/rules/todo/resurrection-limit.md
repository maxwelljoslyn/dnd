name: Resurrection Limit
---

It is not unusual for characters to be raised from the dead, but there is an upper bound on how many times a given character may be brought back to life (by any means.) This **resurrection limit** is the character's original Constitution score. Since most resurrection methods will permanently decrease Constitution, after being resurrected, the character must make a note of their original Constitution score.
