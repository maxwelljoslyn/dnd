This study provides knowledge of how to transition self and others from one existence to another, granting the wherewithal to cross into the ethereal or across the astral planes.


Amateur
Recognize Extraplanar Manifestation: know the typical stats and plane of origin for extraplanar creatures and phenomena, and recognize the same when they appear on the Prime Material.
Understand Planes: knowledge of the terrain, features, hazards, and native entities of the other planes.
Determine Destination Plane: tell which plane a portal leads to.

Authority
Ethereal Jaunt: shift oneself into the Ethereal Plane, allowing one to bypass many Material obstacles.
Extraplanar Mentalities: understand the motivations and behavior of extraplanar creatures, which also grants increased ability to bargain with them.
Construct Temporary Portal: build a magical edifice which manifests a one-use portal to another plane. Edifice can sometimes be recharged, once.

Expert
Astral Projection: send spirit through the Astral Plane, temporarily creating an effect similar to the Avatar spell, but capable of reaching any plane.
Call Extraplanar Denizen: similar to Gate, though unable to reach the "religious" planes (Heaven, Hell, Valhalla, Nirvana, Happy Hunting Grounds).
Determine Precise Destination: tell exactly where on a plane a traveler will end up if they pass through a portal.
Create Planar Exclave: link a tiny region of the Prime Material with another plane, transforming the region to resemble that plane.

Sage
Construct Permanent Portal: as Temporary Portal, but the edifice will automatically become reusable after a period of time. Edifice will resist destruction by mundane means.
Acquire Planar Characteristics: permanently acquire characteristic feature of creatures native to another plane.
Create Pocket Dimension: warp space to create a personal retreat outside of reality itself.
