Mage level information:

![](/files/MageLevels.png)

Minimum ability scores to be a mage: Intelligence 9. (Note that mages with 9-16 Intelligence have some limits on the maximum spell level they can cast.)

A mage with 16 or greater Intelligence gains 10% bonus experience points.

Mages cannot use any armor or any shields, but they may wear helmets. They can choose proficiencies from the following weapons: club, dagger, quarterstaff, sling.

Mages have the following special abilities:

- Mages can cast spells. They gain a certain number of spells each level, and they may cast each spell they know once per day. If a spell is used, in order to regain its power the next day, the mage must get at least 6 hours of sleep, then meditate for 15 minutes per spell level. Spells that are not used on a given day are carried over to the following day and are useable without further meditation, but the once-per-day limit still applies.

    Note that certain minimum Intelligence scores are required to cast mage spells beyond spell level 4. See the Intelligence table.

    Also note that because there are many possible mage spells, mages do not get to choose from every single existing spell when they learn new spells. Instead they choose from a certain subset of the spells of that level, determined as follows: when they gain access to a new level of spells, the mage rolls against their Intelligence for each of those spells, in any order they please. On a successful check, that spell is eligible to be chosen as a spell the mage knows. This process is automated for first level as part of the character background generator.

    The minimum number of eligible choices is the number of spells that a 20th level mage would know for that spell level; if there are too few, the mage rechecks spells, one at a time, until the minimum number of choices is reached. The maximum number of choices is the mage's Intelligence score.

    In effect, the total list of mage spells is filtered by the Intelligence checks, to get those spells which the mage can choose from, and then filtered again by the mage's choices.

for mages only: mage spells are numerous and varied. Thus, unlike all other spellcasting classes. not all mages learn the same spells. When a mage achieves a class level which gains level X spells for the first time, roll % chance (dictated by Int) against each level X spell. Any which pass the % can be chosen to become one of the level X spells that the mage knows.

The number of spells which can be recorded in a spellbook is limited only by the number of pages in the book.
A spellbook is functionally a book of scrolls; thus, in an emergency, a spell can be cast directly from the book, at the cost of completely wiping that spell from the book.


Neither a scroll nor a spellbook can be accidentally triggered by damage, though either can be ruined.
