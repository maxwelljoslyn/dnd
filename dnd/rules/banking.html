$var title: Banking

<p>Coins are heavy, which makes it difficult to transport them long distances. Characters may opt to store their money in a bank, which will issue them a letter of credit drawable at that same bank, or at a certain set of sister banks made known to the character at the time of deposit.</p>

<p>Most banking institutions will require the player to swear certain oaths, usually under the auspices of Detect Lie, in order to open an account. Foreign commoners must typically pay a fee to open an account with a bank outside their home country.</p>

<h2>Security of Banking</h2>

<p>Players can consider money deposited at a bank absolutely safe. Otherwise, the functionality of the bank for gameplay purposes would be compromised.</p>

<h2>Interest Rates</h2>

<p>Typical interest on deposits, for commoners:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Months of Continuous Deposit</th>
<th>Interest Rate</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td> <td>0.5%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2-3</td> <td>1%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4-6</td> <td>1.75%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7-12</td> <td>2.5%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>13+</td> <td>3.5%</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>All interest payments are simple, i.e. they are based only on the principal, not on any accrued interest. Months of interest are calculated as 30-day periods starting from the date of the deposit. If money is withdrawn partway through a 30-day period, there is no fractional interest; that interest payment is <strong>forfeited</strong>.</p>

<div class=example>

<p>Example: Wilmar deposits 100 GP and leaves it in the bank for exactly 4 months and 1 day. His total interest is 4 gp, 2 sp, as shown below:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Months of Wilmar's Deposit</th>
<th>Interest Earned</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1st</td> <td>4 sp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2nd</td> <td>1 gp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3rd</td> <td>1 gp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4th</td> <td>1 gp, 6 sp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 extra day</td> <td>forfeit</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Storing Precious Goods</h2>

Banks will store gems and bars of precious metal for 1% of their assessed value per month (or fraction thereof). All other goods must be stored at a storehouse, which typically charge higher fees, and may also impose a maximum duration for storage.

<h2>Other Ways to Store, Borrow, and Lend</h2>

<p>The nobility have access to better interest rates on deposits. They can also secure loans on the basis of their blood, whereas commoners do not typically have access to institutional credit -- unless they are merchants, moneylenders, guildmasters, or otherwise distinguished.</p>

<p>The character background generator offers several results by which a character may begin the game with access to credit. Characters who take out such a loan, then repay it, will gain access to a larger line of credit for future use.</p>


<p>The typical way to retain value on one's person without carrying copious coinage of coins is to convert coins into "denser" stores of value, typically gemstones. The disadvantage of this method is that gemstone values fluctuate, so when the stone is sold, the seller may get less -- or more -- money than he originally paid for it.</p>

<p>Certain sage abilities, such as those from the study of Mercantilism, give a character better rates on deposit, free access to loans, or the opportunity to become a moneylender. </p>

<p>Other sage abilities allow access to black markets where lucrative deals may be made -- with blood on the line -- or to gambling dens, where money may be won -- and lost -- much more quickly than by banking interest rates.</p>
