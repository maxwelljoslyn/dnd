<h2>Marasa</h2>

<p><strong>Marasa</strong> is a human kingdom on the eastern coast of the warm, temperate southern half of the continent of <strong>Ardane</strong>. With endless forests and easy access to the sea, over time Marasa has come to possess the most powerful navy, and the biggest merchant fleet, on all of Ardane. Marasa's fortune has also grown through exports of lumber and countless varieties of woodcraft, but its most luxurious articles of commerce come in bottles. A climate and terrain uniquely suited to growing grapes have made Marasa unquestionably the finest center of wine production in the western hemisphere.</p>

<p>In short, Marasa is a prosperous and industrious country -- and the most prosperous and industrious city in Marasa is <strong>Allrivers</strong>.</p>

<p>The Free City of <a href="/towns/Allrivers">Allrivers</a> sits at the mouth of the mile-wide <strong>Oak River</strong>, in the <strong>Duchy of Chialto</strong> in southeastern Marasa. Although not the center of royal administrative power like the capital, Sacra Mara, Allrivers is the most important commercial center in Marasa, and it influences trade hundreds of miles away. The city is famous for its naval and commercial shipyards, annual sailboat races, unparalleled Glass Harbor views of the sunrise, and tightly-wound streets of carvers, turners, and engravers.</p>

<p><strong>Duke Gavino Bernardi</strong>, 3rd Duke of Chialto, is the most powerful nobleman in the kingdom (outside the royal family), and a tenant-in-chief to the king. As Allrivers is a free city, directly subject to <strong>King Carlos II</strong>, the Duke cannot directly tax its trade. However, as the city lies within his lands, Duke Chialto retains the right to appoint one of the city's aldermen, which position is currently filled by his eldest son, <strong>Profundo Bernardi</strong>, 2nd Baron of Marna.</p>

<p> Duke Chialto's daughter and Lord Marna's older sister, <strong>Lucretia Bernardi</strong>, is married to Ignacio Lucca. <strong>Ignacio Lucca</strong>, 5th Baron of Rodena, is vassal to the Duke of Chialto. The Barony of Rodena is the most southeasterly domain in the kingdom; Lord Rodena's lands border the gnomish <strong>Kingdom of Amber</strong>, and <strong>Searest</strong>, the seat of the barony, is the first stop for gnomish travelers and traders entering Marasa by land.</p>

<p><strong>Gransignor Lazlo Lucca</strong>, Lord Rodena's younger brother, holds a fief of immediacy south of Caterpillar Island. A retired 2nd lieutenant in the Marasan navy, Gransignor Lazlo was made a knight for courage in battle; he was created a grand knight when, after the captain and 1st lieutenant were both killed, he assumed command of the <i>Royal Oak</i> and led it to victory in the Battle of Sugar Strait.</p>

<p>To fulfill his obligations as an alderman of Allrivers, Lord Marna is generally away from his fine brick manor at the northern crest of <strong>Pearl Island</strong>. As the island is a critically important center in the production of olive oil, and a notable source of fish, especially eels, a trusted steward, Adaccio Leto, serves as prefect in Lord Marna's stead.</p>
