$var title: Falconry

<i>Adapted from <a href="https://wiki.alexissmolensk.com/index.php/Falconry_(sage_study)">rules by Alexis Smolensk</a>.</i>

<p>
Falconry is the pursuit of a union between man and bird, for sport, for war, and for companionship.
</p>

<p>
A "falcon" is a hawk, eagle, or owl (all interchangeable for game purposes) which exists in a state of semi-captive wildness tempered by training. Although falcon follows orders, it retains its capacity for independent action, and its natural ferocity toward prey; it shouldn't be thought of as "tame" in the same way as a dog, cow, or horse.
</p>

<p>
A falcon serves as a status symbol, for the mastery of these birds is viewed as a sign of quality lineage and personal worth. The sage abilities below reflect this, as well as the practical application of both lesser and greater birds as friends, servants, and sources of passion.
</p>

<p>
A character beginning play with Falconry as a study also begins play with a trained falcon, which has been the character's companion for at least a year.

<h2>Falconry Equipment</h2>

<p>
The most important piece of equipment in falconry is the <strong>hood</strong>.
</p>

<p>
When handling a falcon, the falconer must wear, on one hand, a <strong>falconry glove</strong>. This thick, padded leather gauntlet protects against the bird's claws. Gloves wear out with use.
</p>

<p>
Falcons are equipped with a pair of small <strong>bells</strong>, which help alert the falconer to the bird's presence. Falcons fly so swiftly that the sounds of the bells do not harm its chances while hunting.
</p>

<p>
The falconer must also equip each bird with <strong>jesses</strong>[1] - short, thin leather thongs - around the bird's legs. The jesses are slitted so that they can be looped through themselves, forming an effective restraint without harming the bird. The free ends of the jesses are tied to the falconry glove.
</p>

<p>
When the bird is out in the field, it wears <em>flying jesses</em>. These are very short and minimally slitted so they don't tangle the bird in branches or other obstacles. When the bird is at rest, it wears <em>mews jesses</em>, which are longer so the bird has more freedom of movement while tethered.
</p>

<p>
A <strong>mews</strong> is an unusually large birdhouse or aviary built to the special requirements of a bird of prey. During the day, the bird can also rest on a <strong>falconry perch</strong>. Both mews and perches are usually made of sturdy wood, though rich falconers might construct either to be far more elaborate.
</p>

<p>
Finally, while a falcon is being trained, the falconer uses a <strong>creance</strong> - a light, thin, and lengthy leather leash - to keep the young bird from flying beyond a certain distance.
</p>

<p>
Because a first-level character with amateur study of falconry, whether through their class or their background, begins play with a trained falcon, such a character will also begin play with sufficient equipment for one bird: 1 hood, 1 falconry glove, 1 pair of bells, 1 pair each of flight and mews jesses, 1 creance, and 1 ordinary falconry perch.

[1] Pronounced "jessies." The singular is "jess."

<h2>Caring for a Falcon</h2>

<p>
A falcon must be fed 1 lb of food daily, on a carnivorous diet. The best food is whole small animals, such as mice and quails. If some of the daily food requirement is instead met with butchered meat, the falcon must additionally be fed an equivalent amount of roughage (such as fur and feathers) to aid in digestion; said roughage will be regurgitated in pellets.
</p>

<p class=example>
Example: Apollo feeds his falcon a plump 1/2-lb quail in the morning, then in the afternoon feeds it 1/2 lb of cow and pig offal, plus a supplementary 1/2 lb of roughage for digestion.
