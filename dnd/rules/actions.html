<p>An <strong>action</strong> is any interaction a character takes in the game world. Declaring a character's next action is one of the two "operations" of playing the game (the other operation, gathering information, covers all preparation prior to declaring an action; this includes consulting the rules, asking questions of the referee, reviewing a character sheet, and so on.)</p>

<p>Actions which take hours or days to perform, from hunting to shopping to building a cartwheel, cannot reasonably accomplished in combat. Actions which take seconds or minutes to perform <em>can</em> be accomplished in combat, and have a specified cost in <strong>action points</strong> (AP).</p>

<p>Combatants have a certain number of AP per round, usually 5. The more AP a combatant has on his turn, the more he can do.</p>

<p>In all cases, all items or tools operated on during an action must be prepared and at-hand when the combatant acts. Thus, poison cannot be applied to a weapon without having first retrieved and unsealed the container of poison and drawn the weapon in question.</p>

<h2>
Extending an Action Over Multiple Rounds
</h2>

<p>If an action requires more AP than a combatant's <strong>total AP per round</strong>, such that the only way it could be done is by "spilling over" into following rounds, then this spillover is acceptable, and the spilled-over AP is subtracted from the combatant's normal total for the following round.</p>

<p>However, if the action does not in itself take up more AP than one round's worth, the combatant cannot split the action up. He <strong>must</strong> take the action all in one turn, or else <strong>wait for his next turn</strong> to perform it.</p>

<h2>Actions and AP Costs</h2>

Each action links to more detailed rules governing it.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Action</th>
<th>AP Cost</th>
</tr>
$for action in action_names:
    $ info = actions[action]
    $ cost = str(info['cost'])
    <tr>
      <td><a href=#$idify(action)>$action</a></td>
    <td>$cost</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Action Descriptions</h2>

$for action in action_names:
		$ info = actions[action]
    <h3 id=$idify(action)>$action</h3>
    $ cost = str(info['cost'])
    <p>Cost: $cost</p>
    $ desc = info.get('description')
    $if desc:
        <p>$desc</p>

<h2>Example Action Sequences</h2>

<div class=example>

<p>Verm the thief wants to use his sling in combat. He has 5 AP. We assume Verm's sling bullets are held in his non-weapon hand or otherwise in easy reach. If that were not true, Verm would have to use the Retrieve Object action on Turn 1, preventing him from Loading and Aiming until Turn 2, and from firing until Turn 3.</p>

<p>
Turn 1:
Draw Weapon, Light One-Handed: 1 AP
Load and Aim: 4 AP
</p>


<p>
Turn 2:
Attack with Weapon: 2 AP
</p>

</div>

<div class=example>

<p>
Obediah the assassin wants to get his shield off his back and defend himself with it.
</p>

<p>
Unsling Shield from Shoulder: 2 AP
Adjust Item for Use: 1 AP
Total AP: 3
</p>

<h2>
Sage Studies and Actions
</h2>

Some sage abilities provide whole new actions for characters to perform; others affect the number of action points needed to accomplish certain actions.

For instance, characters with the Flexibility sage ability (usually gained through the Physical Balance study) subtract 1 AP from the costs for these actions:

<ul>
<li>stand from laying</li>
<li>stand from seated position</li>
<li>dismount animal</li>
<li>mount animal</li>
<li>drop to the ground</li>
<li>unsling backpack</li>
</ul>
