$var title: Critical Hit

A critical hit (also called a "critical" or "crit") results when an attack die comes up with a natural (unmodified) 20.

<p>
A typical critical hit deals double damage: the damage dice for a critical hit are calculated as normal, and the result is then doubled. This is sometimes called a "2x" critical to distinguish it from super criticals.
</p>

<h2>Super Criticals</h2>

There is a chance that a critical will deal even better than double damage, making it a super critical.

<p>
After a critical is rolled, the attacker rolls another d20. On a 1-18, there is no change. On a 19, if the defender is wearing a helmet (or has a naturally armored head, like a stegosaurus), there is also no change. In either case, the critical stays at 2x damage.
</p>

<p>
If, howver, this d20 comes up a natural 19, and the attacker is not wearing a helmet, damage is tripled (3x).
</p>

<p>
Lastly, if this d20 comes up a natural 20, damage is tripled <strong>and the super critical procedure repeats indefinitely</strong>. Thus there's always the possibility, however small, for a super critical to deal 4x, 5x, or even greater damage.

<h2>Critical Hits and Assassination</h2>

A critical hit when attempting assassination improves the range of enemies that can be assassinated. See <a href="/rules/assassination">Assassination</a>.

<h2>Critical Hits and Backstabbing</h2>

A critical hit when backstabbing adds together the damage multipliers of the two effects. Since backstabbing normally deals double damage, a critical backstab deals 3x damage, a backstab which is a 3x critical deals 4x damage, and so on.
