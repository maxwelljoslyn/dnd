$var title: Assassination

<p>
To assassinate, a target must be surprised; this is most frequently accomplished through stealth. On a successful attack roll, instead of normal damage, the assassin rolls <strong>assassination dice</strong>: 2d4-5+X. X is the assassin's level if he is Amateur or higher in the study of Murder; X is 1/2 the assassin's level, rounded down, if he is not.
</p>

<p>
If the result of the assassination dice is equal to or greater than the target's total HD from race and levels, the target is <strong>instantly killed</strong>. Otherwise, normal weapon damage is dealt.
</p>

<p>
If the attack roll to assassinate is a <a href="/rules/critical-hit">critical hit</a>, the assassin adds 1 less than the damage multiplier to the assassination dice. Thus, a normal (2x) critical adds 1, a 3x critical adds 2, and so on. This is separate from the normal damage increase of a critical hit, which still applies if the assassination dice fail.

<div class=example>
  Example: Finbolg is an 8th-level assassin with 28 points in Murder, making him an Amateur. He attempts to assassinate and makes his attack roll. His assassination dice are 2d4-5+8 = 2d4+3. A creature with 5 or fewer HD (for instance, a 4th-level character of any playable race) will die no matter the roll, since the minimum on 2d4+3 is 5.
