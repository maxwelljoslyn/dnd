<h1>Rouse to Hunt</h1>

<p>
With this amateur-tier Falconry ability, a character can send a trained falcon off to hunt certain kinds of game, for all the purposes that one might go hunting oneself: sport, furs, food, and so on.
</p>

<p>
A falcon is capable of hunting for ground fowl, waterfowl, or burrowing mammals. This follows the rules for hunting those creatures as given by the <a href="https://wiki.alexissmolensk.com/index.php/Hunting_(sage_ability)">Hunting sage ability</a>, save that distance to the target is ignored: if the falcon's attack succeeds (see below), it is assumed to have caught and killed its prey.
</p>

<p>
When a hunter's first attempt to bag an animal be unsuccessful, if he wishes to keep hunting, he must roll the time required to find new prey. This applies to the falcon, too.
</p>

<p>
To successfully take its prey, the falcon makes an attack roll (d20+3) against AC 12. A highly-trained falcon, or one of a rare species, may gain a bonus, while unusual prey animals may be be smaller or larger, with higher or lower AC. There are also pieces of equipment and even spells with which a dedicated falconer can further improve his bird's attacks.
</p>

<p>
A hunting falcon will return to its master after half a hunting day (5 hours) or after making a successful attack, whichever comes first. A victorious falcon will return with its prey intact; a good falconer will let it keep some of the catch as a reward.
