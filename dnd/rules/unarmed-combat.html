<h1>Unarmed Combat</h1>

<i>Adapted from <a href="https://wiki.alexissmolensk.com/index.php/Unarmed_Combat_(sage_study)">rules by Alexis Smolensk</a>.</i>

<p>This study improves a character's ability to fight without weapons. A student of unarmed combat gains improved damage when fighting without weapons, and can employ specialized, more powerful versions of the rules for brawling (wresting/pinning), grabbing (pushing opponents around), and overbearing (attacking such that enemies are forced to fall back.)

<p>At higher tiers of the study, the character can gain skill at savate (foot-fighting), improve their bare-handed attacks to truly deadly levels, and even learn some of the specialized kung-fu kicks and punches ordinarily restricted to <a href="/rules/monk">monks</a>.</p>
