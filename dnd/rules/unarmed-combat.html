$var title: Unarmed Combat

<i>Adapted from <a href="https://wiki.alexissmolensk.com/index.php/Unarmed_Combat_(sage_study)">rules by Alexis Smolensk</a>.</i>

<p>This study improves a character's ability to fight without weapons. A student of unarmed combat gains improved damage when fighting without weapons, and can employ specialized, more powerful versions of the rules for brawling (wresting/pinning), grabbing (pushing opponents around), and overbearing (attacking such that enemies are forced to fall back.)

<p>At higher tiers of the study, the character gains foot-fighting skills, improves their bare-handed damage to truly formidable levels, and even learns some of the specialized kung-fu kicks and punches ordinarily restricted to <a href="/rules/monk">monks</a>.</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>

<h3>Amateur (10-29 points)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Strong Grip: reduces chance of being disarmed, when opponent grabs or brawls, from 1/6 to 1/12.</li>
<li>Boxing: increases base unarmed damage from 1d4-2 to 1d4.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.alexissmolensk.com/index.php/Clinch_Fighting_(sage_ability)">Clinch Fighting</a>: a superior form of brawling which virtually nullifies an opponent's actions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Authority (30-59 points)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Bear Hug: a superior form of brawling which automatically deals crushing damage.</li>
<li>Takedown: an improved grab which throws an opponent to the ground, similar to the monk's Throw ability.</li>
<li>Disarm: make a melee attack which grasps the enemy's arm, wrist, or weapon itself to force that weapon out of the enemy's grip. Causes the same damage as pummeling, i.e. base unarmed damage. Disarmed weapon is dropped as if the enemy had fumbled. This ability is superior to the disarm chance offered by grabbing or brawling because if this attack hits, the disarm always takes place.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Expert (61-99 points)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Open Hand Fighting: Gain a lesser version of the monk's signature fighting style, further improving base unarmed damage beyond the limits of boxing.</li>
<li>Hammer Strike: expend 3 AP and use both hands to strike with a double-fisted grip. If the attack hits and doesn't stun, the target will still be knocked back one hex as if stunned. If the attack hits and stuns, the target is instead knocked back two hexes.</li>
<li>Snap Kick: the character can kick nearly as well as they punch, permitting pummeling attacks even without the use of the hands. Snap Kick deals base unarmed damage minus 1.</li>
<li>Sweep: upon stunning a target, expend 2 AP to sweep the opponent's legs out from under them. No attack roll required. Deals no damage, but grants +2 to anyone's attacks made while the target is stunned and downed.</li>
<li>Improved Disarm: As Disarm, but the character may choose to retain the enemy's weapon in hand.</li>
</ul>
