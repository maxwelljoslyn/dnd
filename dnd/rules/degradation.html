$var title: Degradation of Items

<p>The items carried by a character will wear out over time, as a result of normal use, undue strain, accidents, improper storage, and exposure to the elements. Players must take care to pack extra units of anything which they dearly need.</p>

<h2>Terms</h2>

<p>Every item has a rating called <strong>newness</strong>, ranging from 0 to 5. A brand-new item has a newness of 5. A totally broken item has a newness of 0.</p>

<p>A <strong>degradation check</strong> (AKA <strong>durability</strong> check) determines whether an item has decreased in newness. If an item's degradation check returns a 1, that item loses 1 point of newness.</p>

<p>A degradation check is normally rolled on 1d6. Some sage abilities or other characteristics improve this to a larger die, lowering the chance of degradation. This usually represents a character's familiarity with proper handling and care for a category of items, such as glassware.</p>

<h2>Degradation Intervals</h2>

<p>A <strong>degradation interval</strong> is the frequency at which an item carried by a character must roll a degradation check. Ideally, this frequency would be calculated from the game date that the item was first made anew, bought in new condition, or repaired to newness 5. Until such is computationally feasible, this frequency is instead calculated by the day of year, no matter when the item was purchased.</p>

<p>The typical degradation intervals are 1 day, 1 week, 1 fortnight, 1 month, and 1 season (3 months.)</p>

<p>Except for foodstuffs, items that are not carried along with the character, and which are properly stored, change their degradation interval to 1 month.</p>

<h2>Degradation of Magic Items</h2>

<p>Magic items roll degradation checks on two dice, and only degrade if both dice come up 1.</p>

<h2>Usability of Degraded Items</h2>

<p>Items with newness 4 still function if they were brand new; this is an intentional "freebie."</p>

<p>Items with a newness of 3 lose some of their original usefulness. Weapons have a -1 attack penalty; armor has a -1 AC penalty; food has a chance of sickening its consumer; and so on. Many more cases are still TBD.</p>

<p>Items with a newness of 2 or 1 are in even worse shape than items of newness 3.</p>

<p>Items with a newness of 0 are completely broken and neither functional nor reparable.</p>
