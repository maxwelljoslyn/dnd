abandon the split between goods and services... they can all just be references?
I guess the difference is that services don't have a *unit* ... indeed I don't know how they would
todo how should it be handled when there are both cereals and flour? surely flour is a derived good...
ditto for cotton -> cloth -> cotton cloth, or sheep -> wool -> wool cloth -> woolens

perhaps I'd use "woolens" as the "service" reference for producing woolen goods, with no tailor involvement becaus there exists this _more specific_ reference
meanwhile the "tailor" would be the service reference to transform from cotton cloth to cotton goods

but that has a problem:

if "woolens" have a production total but "tailor" doesn't, then in the new equivalent of ResourcePriceCalculator, woolens could get a cost per unit but tailor couldn't
in that case how would/should/could the WOOLENS PRODUCTION influence the cost of wool goods? it's verrrrry weird to have "category of final good" eg woolens as one of the RAW REFERENCES in the system


my old way of doing it really made sense. no "more specific goods" in the material references.


one solution is to eliminate any "final goods categories" references if they conflict with service references
so don't eliminate "tools" since that means "toolmaking", nor "wine" since that means "winemaking"
but do eliminate "Woolens" since that would be done by the tailor/weaver/whatever


oh god there's a CLOTHING reference ... wouldn't that just be the tailor???


another issue ... soap made from tallow would be "tallow" -> "soap"
but candles made from wax would use "candles and wax" as the base reference, and presumably the "chandler" as the service
however, both soap and candles are sold by the chandler. so shouldn't "chandler" be needed after the soap reference? shouldn't the SERVICE reference always be required, even when there's a "category of goods" reference?
ah yes, I like this solution. a service reference is always needed at the end. therefore, "woolens" just happen to have an extra step involved b/c I have the reference available. perhaps we can assume sufficient additional steps that "woolen" represents all the intermediate processes...


finally ... note i don't actually HAVE a tailor, or weaver, or leathermaker references ... only specific categories of good. and it's fucking weird to have production totals for ironmongery and alchemy. dont' know what to do with those.
i suppose I will have to scrap or combine some of Alexis's underlying data ... which is fine. the logic of the system will remain intact


also : I could make use of the "production total" of a "category" reference by taking, say, the weight in pounds of 1 sq yard wool cloth  (as calculated up through the use of the "wool cloth" reference), treating that wool cloth at that stage as a semigood, and putting it through another recipe governed by "woolens" with the amount of "woolens" influence detemined by how many pounds the wool cloth was?
but again, my previous design had NO unit for recipe-governing references ... because services were fundamentally distinct.

oh, hell with it. I will just IGNORE these issues for now and refine the system over time -- so there!
